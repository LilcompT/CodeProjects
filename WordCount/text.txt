With regards to the subject above I would like to request that I be moved 
onto the two-hour contract due to a time clash with my following job in 
the kitchen at Eastlea Community School This issue is occurring because there 
are two caretakers who open clash the school at different times therefore causing the 
time clash For me this issue is resolved by switching onto the two-hour contract 
where this issue is negated regardless of what time the school is opened I would like 
this contract amendment to be enforced on the 1st September 2016
